# Kaylee Dockter CS3750 Portfolio
Hello, my name is Kaylee Dockter. 
I am a student at Weber State University pursuing a Computer Science degree with a minor in Mathematics.
I am also currently working as a Business Intelligence Account Manager at Marketstar.

Checkout out some of my most recent projects below. Each link to their respective github repos.

## Projects:

***Created With***

PHP, SQL

***Overview***

This project plays through a simple game of hangman. The user is required to sign up or login in to play
and is given 12 attempts to guess the word properly. The game finishes with a scoreboard ranking the player.

***Challenges***

This project was the first time I had ever been exposed to php, so it was a bit of a learning curve at the start.
I especially had trouble with the session variables.
I'd say out of all the projects though, this went the smoothest in terms of my understanding of the concepts and languages used.

***Sample Code***
```
```
### [Bank](https://github.com/rflowers45/TigerBanking)

***Created With***

.NET 6 framework, MVC, Entity Framework, Javascript, JQuery, C#

***Overview***

This project displays a banking app that allows the user to deposit and withdraw money into one of their bank accounts. 
The app also allows the user to view previous transactions for each of the accounts.

***Challenges***

I would say our greatest challenge for this project was understanding and properly implementing MVC and Entity Framework
as none of us had previously worked in them before.
I personally had never worked in C# either which was a challenge at the start for me as well.

***Sample Code***
